# Binary | Malware Engine Revenge

## Info

> Last time, only one team was able to defuse the malware in the engine firmware.
>
> Now malware is returned. 
>

## Run

Give participants a binary from deploy/static

## Short description

> ELF32bit MIPS BE

## Solution

> 1. Almost half of the flag is checked using very simple algorithms and some parts of flag is plaintext in binary
>
> 2. The other half is checked using a simple, virtual machine, but due to the fact that it is MIPS it is difficult to understand what it is doing.
>
> 3. The best option would be to use the Ghidra, as it produces a good decompiled code
