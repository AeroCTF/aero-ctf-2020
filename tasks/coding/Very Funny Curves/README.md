## Run

`sudo docker-compose up` and ip:port of service

## Short description

> Character construction using curves that are formally defined. From the symbols a formula is formed that needs to be calculated. You need to go through 100 rounds.

## Solution

> 1. We construct the obtained functions in the XY mode by changing the value of t from 0 to 1.
>
> 2. The constructed curves are saved as an image.
>
> 3. Recognize formulas from the image.
>
> 4. We make the calculation.
>
> 5. We send the answer.
